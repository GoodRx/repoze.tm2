0.4

 Depend on zopelib rather than ZODB 3.8.0b3 distribution, because the
 ZODB distribution pulls in various packages (zope.interface and ZEO
 most notably) that are incompatible with stock Zope 2.10.4 apps and
 older sandboxes.  We'll need to revisit this.

0.3

 Provide limited compatibility for older transaction package versions
 which don't support the 'transaction.isDoomed' API.

0.2

 Provide after_end API for registering callbacks at transaction end.
